Description of the major reactions in the carbon cycle. One thing that bothers me
still is why burial of biogenic carbonate is a CO2 source while burial of authigenic carbonate is a sink. And all of the burials are carbon sinks. -- Matthieu

### CO2 sinks

* Weathering of carbonate

>XCO3 + CO2 + H20 --> X + 2HCO3-   
The products are carried to the oceans.  
Example: X = Ca2+

* Weathering of silicate on land
* Weathering of silicate in marine sediments

>Silicate + CO2 --> clay + cation + H2SiO4 + HCO3-  
Dissolved products are carried to the oceans.

* Burial of particulate organic carbon
* Burial of authigenic carbonates
* Burial of methane in marine sediments


### CO2 sources

* Degassing of mantle

>CO2 release at spreading centers, subduction zones and volcanoes.

>Flux estimates from 3He isotope and "known" CO2/3He ratio.    
Some estimates also come from magma production and degree of 
partial melting studies.

* Metamorphic degassing of carbonates
* Metamorphic degassing of particulate organic carbon

>High temperature and pressure conditions at convergent continental
margins may lead to release of CO2 from carbonate and organic matter.

>Metamorphic decarbonation also happen in subducted slabs.

* Weathering of particulate organic carbon

>?

* Burial of biogenic carbonate

### Carbon sinks

* Burial of biogenic carbonate
* Burial of authigenic carbonates
* Burial of particulate organic carbon
* Burial of methane in marine sediments


* Alteration of the oceanic crust

>Basaltic oceanic crust + HCO3- -> CaCO3 + altered crust

### Carbon sources

* Degassing of mantle

>CO2 release at spreading centers, subduction zones and volcanoes.

>Flux estimates from 3He isotope and "known" CO2/3He ratio.    
Some estimates also come from magma production and degree of 
partial melting studies.

* Weathering of carbonates

>This was a CO2 sink but is a carbon source.
