#Carbonate-Silicate cycle

Silicate weathering
$$
\ce{ CaSiO3 + 2CO2 + H2O -> Ca++ + 2HCO3- + SiO2 }
$$

Carbonate formation (some abiotic, some catalysed by organisms to make shells)
$$
\ce{ Ca++ + 2HCO3- -> CaCO3 + CO2 + H2O }
$$

Metamorphosis (in lithosphere)
(This does not balance the silicate weathering reaction - \ce{CaCO3} is building up over time, not in steady state)
$$
\ce{ CaCO3 + SiO2 -> CaSiO3 + CO2 }
$$

**But...** we also have this reaction, performed by bacteria that reduce sulfate in sediments rich in organic matter
$$
\ce{ SO4^2- + 2C_{org} + H2O -> H2S + 2HCO3- }
$$
This bicarbonate is also turned into carbonate by the same reaction as above,
$$
\ce{ Ca++ + 2HCO3- -> CaCO3 + CO2 + H2O }
$$
(though this could be counted as a separate reaction since it occurs in a different place)

Aaargh! I *thought* the point here was that the burial of the resulting carbonate is a net $\ce{CO2}$ sink in the latter place because the C in the $\ce{C_{org}}$ comes ultimately from the atmosphere through photosynthesis. But then the same is true in the former case as well - the C comes from $\ce{CO2}$ via siliate weathering.
