water buried in the mantle per m2 seafloor: 3.3-6.8e5 kg
which can be split among the following contributions
- sediments 0.6e5 kg
- crust 1.7e5 kg
- serpentinized mantle 0.9-4.6e5 kg
- deep recycling 
water directly released directly through volcanism (slab fluids): 3-4.4e5 kg
which leaves a net flux to the mantle of 0.2-2.4e5 kg
memo: all of this is per m2 seafloor
